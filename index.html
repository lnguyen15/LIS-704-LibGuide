(2016). The book: a cover-to-cover exploration of the most powerful object of our time. New York: W.W. Norton & Company.<br />
<br />
<br />
A comprehensive, well-researched, and fascinating source about how books became so important in society. The author covers everything from history of the book, starting with etched surfaces, the transition to paper, and into the present, with mass-produced publications. Houston gives the reader interesting tidbits about little known facts pertaining to the history of the book and emphasizes the importance of illustrations, along with words, in the making of the book.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Book: a Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of Our Time by Keith Houston is a wonderful resource for LIS 712 because it gives a broad and engaging history of the printed book. This book covers the time line that is discussed in this course, from the 1500's to the present, but also extends the history prior to the 1500's by mentioning how the history of writing emerged into the history of the book.<br />

(2014). Thinking outside the box. Amherst, Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts Press.<br />
<br />
Thinking Outside the Book is an investigation of the role of women in publishing culture. Rohrbach writes about influential women from the 19th century and how they have shaped literature/publishing. This book goes beyond the history of the book and delves into the intersectional nature of something as important as the book.<br />
<br />
Augusta's Rohrbach's Thinking Outside the Book is a thought-provoking resource for LIS 712 because it is from the perspective of the marginalized. Rohrbach explores deeper implications of the book and applies these ideas to modern iterations of information delivery.<br />

(2016). Print culture histories beyond the metropolis. Toronto, Ontario: University of Toronto Press.<br />
<br />
This collection of essays focuses on print culture in fringe locales rather than in large cities, where print industry is bustling. The places studied range from the US to Australia.<br />
<br />
For LIS 712, Print Culture Histories Beyond the Metropolis is an appropriate read to understand how printing affected populations who did not exist in central hubs of commerce. It is important to study the effects of print in marginal places.<br />

(2013). Publishing blackness: textual constructions of race since 1850. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press.<br />
<br />
Publishing Blackness is a collection of essays on the intersection of race and the control of print culture in the US. The essays cover topics including the Harlem Renaissance and the FBI investigations on prominent black leaders. The print literature about and by African Americans informed how race was thought about in America.<br />
<br />
From the African American perspective, Publishing Blackness is a noteworthy resource for LIS 712 in that it allows a more nuanced understanding of how print culture and race intertwines with one another. The book discusses contemporary thought on race in relation to print, which will inform students on the current discourse.<br />

<br />
Science in Print collects nine essays about the history of science, relating it to print culture. The book covers different fields of science, including mathematics, and science education.<br />
<br />
This book is extremely fitting for LIS 712 because the focus of the class is on "dissemination of scientific discoveries and ideas" through print. While the other sources supplement the history of print by offering diverse perspectives, this book specifically concentrates on the field of science.<br />

<br />
Pressing the Fight is a detailed book that has essays on how print affected the Cold War and vice versa. The book discusses how images and words can propel propaganda.<br />
<br />
Another important read for LIS 712 is Pressing the Fight. While the topic of war may be difficult to discuss, it's important to remember and understand how print can be used as a tool in war time.<br />

<br />
Phillip H. Round researches the development of print culture in Native history, starting with John Eliot's Bible in 1663. He proposes how Native peoples utilized the Western mode of printing and publishing as a tool to preserve their own culture.<br />
<br />
Removable Type is another resource that provides a perspective of print culture that deviates from the Western canon. This book can be an essential read in LIS 712 because it concentrates on often ignored perspectives from the Native community.<br />

<br />
Raúl Coronado's A World Not to Come examines Latino culture through the lens of print history. He analyzes the importance of oral tradition, religion, and revolution in Latin America's print culture.<br />
<br />
A World Not to Come offers a Latino perspective in print history that diverges from the typical European and white canon that is often emphasized. This book would be an important read in LIS 712 because it shows the way in which print informs a major culture.<br />

Make Your Own History is a contemporary book about the importance in modern society to document marginalized cultures. It focuses on feminist and queer communities in particular and contains essays on collecting and archiving materials pertaining to feminist and queer experiences.<br />
<br />
This progressive book by Bly and Wooten would be an insightful source for LIS 712 to show how alternative modes of printing and publishing are being implemented today. This book will allow students to compare the purposes of print literature from 1500 when the printing press was employed to printing's modern uses.<br />

Archives in Libraries is a special book that advocates for collaboration within the LIS field. It is written for those who work in academic or public libraries that may house historical or cultural archives as a part of their collection.<br />
<br />
While this book caters to archivists, it may be of interest to LIS 712 students who are inspired to do archival or preservation work. As a portion of this class focuses on identifying books through examining its properties, this resource may be helpful for those leaning towards the archival field.<br />
